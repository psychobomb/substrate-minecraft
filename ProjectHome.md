**Substrate** is a fully-developed .NET SDK for editing Minecraft worlds.  Substrate provides high- and low-level APIs for manipulating Alpha and Beta-compatible maps and player data.  Substrate is developed in C# as a CLS-compliant assembly, and example code is provided for both C# and VB.NET.  A brief list of Substrate's capabilities are:

  * Alpha and Beta map compatibility
  * Separate block, chunk, and region views
  * Global and local coordinate systems
  * Automatic and manual light recalculation
  * Automatic and manual fluid recalculation
  * Automatic chunk cache management
  * Automatic TileEntity and Heightmap consistency
  * Entity editing support
  * Player editing support
  * Level data editing support
  * Edit existing worlds or create new ones
  * Schematic import and export
  * Low-level APIs for NBT reading, writing, and validation

Most of the Substrate APIs are fully documented, including a compiled API reference document and XML documentation for Intellisense.  A number of different example projects are provided in C# and VB.NET.

Substrate is compatible with .NET Framework 2.0 or higher and Mono, and should be compatible with any CLI language.
